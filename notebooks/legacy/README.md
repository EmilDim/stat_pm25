These notebooks are from my original efforts to reproduce Shen et al (2017); they're really only intended as reference to see the steps I took in order to complete this work. Often times they'll rely on other packages I built to help with the project (and others), but may not be explicitly re-packaged here. However, hopefully they provide useful in terms of documenting my thoughts and problem solving process.
